// Written against NimBLE-Arduino ~1.4.x's API (pinned in platformio.ini).
// Confirmed working end-to-end on real hardware against a Spark GO: connect,
// patch change + confirmation + resulting preset read (multi-chunk
// reassembly), active-patch query, tuner start/stop + data frames, effect
// toggle. Non-obvious things it took real-hardware testing to find, see the
// comments below where they're handled:
// - subscribe()'s CCCD write must be write-WITH-response (the `response`
//   param) - write-without-response reported success but the Spark GO never
//   actually started sending notifications (rawNotificationCount() stuck at
//   0 forever despite cccdFound()/lastSubscribeOk() both true).
// - a patch-change command is sometimes acked with the generic CMD 0x04
//   ack (no payload) instead of the richer CMD 0x03 confirmation
//   PROTOCOL.md documents (which carries the new patch number) - handle
//   both, since which one arrives isn't consistent.
// - an effect-toggle command gets the *same* generic-ack treatment (CMD
//   0x04/SUB_CMD 0x15, no payload) instead of the richer CMD 0x03
//   confirmation - on real hardware this was actually the *only* ack ever
//   observed for effect toggles (never the rich one), so this isn't a rare
//   edge case here, it's the norm. Handled the same way as the patch-change
//   case: remember what we ourselves just asked for (toggleEffect()) and
//   apply that instead of waiting for a payload that isn't coming.
