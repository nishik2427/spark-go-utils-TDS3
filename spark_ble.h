// NimBLE central role: finds and connects to the Spark GO, writes commands,
// and reassembles/parses its notifications. Mirrors ble_backend.py's shape
// (scan/connect/disconnect/send_patch/tuner_start/tuner_stop/toggle_effect/
// request_preset/request_active_patch) with one difference: characteristics
// are discovered by UUID rather than hardcoded handles, which is more robust
// for an unattended embedded client than the desktop app's fixed-handle
// shortcut.
//
// Known limitation: the scan and connect phases each still block for their
// own duration - acceptable since they're rare (startup + occasional
// reconnects), but USB-MIDI input isn't serviced while one is in flight. The
// two phases are split across separate loop() iterations (see loop()'s own
// comments) so the display gets a chance to show "Scanning..."/
// "Connecting..." in between - each phase individually still blocks, only
// the transition between them doesn't.
