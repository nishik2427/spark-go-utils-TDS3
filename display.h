// 0.96" ST7735 status screen. Deliberately "dumb" - callers (main.cpp) decide
// what to show and when; this module only knows how to draw it. Three views:
// - status: connection/rx/subscribe diagnostics - shown before a BLE
//   connection is established (or if it's lost), since that's when knowing
//   what's going on actually matters.
// - connected: big patch number + patch name + last MIDI command, shown once
//   connected - the diagnostics aren't interesting anymore once things are
//   confirmed working.
// - tuner: detected note + a rough cents bar, shown while the tuner is
//   toggled on (see tuner.h) - takes priority over both of the above.
